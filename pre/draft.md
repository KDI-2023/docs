Hello every1, my name, my teammates and I are from JLU.

I will report from these parts.

part 1

This is my team.

When we search for Kiana on Pixiv, notice that there is an underscore 下划线 between the two words, which tells us that there are these tags.

指屏幕 You see, for these tags, if they have different case, or are underscore, or are simply translated into a different language, they will be treated as different tags.

very inconvenient

part 3

To the user, these are tags. Here (label), this word is actually better used as tag. For example, a character is kind. kind is tag. However, in order to distinguish it from the user-oriented tag, we call it label.

We created a wordnet-like web page and a program-oriented API. We can click on the link (作品, 名侦探柯南).

These two APIs mean two needs:

1. Users viewing the illustrations, search by words, not clear. We give users relevant tags based on words.
2. Artists who draw illustrations. ML model, classify, result is clear, so the uri can be used. Here, we temporarily use uuid instead.

part 4

1st, you know, in some contries, it hadr to access some website. of coruse, i can;t type them in this ppt.

We triggered the anti-climbing of pixiv. We use proxy pools to solve this problem.

about 1.3 TB. with pics. ignore the pics.
We solve this problem by batch processing.

Conan is Kudo Shinichi?

Arknights.
They have completely different illustration styles.
In the plot, they are the same person.
She experienced some things, such as resurrection, and her personality changed.
