# Use Case

#### Use Case 0

User: General users viewing the illustrations.

They search by words.

The words are not clear.

We give users relevant tags based on words.

The `search` api in [Flask-UI](https://github.com/KDI-2023/flask-ui) is an implementation of this feature.

#### Use Case 1

User: Illustration artists.

When they upload their artwork, other automated programs, such as machine learning models, will classify their work.

The results of the classifications are clear. It can be Uri. We temporarily use uuid instead here.

The `uid` api in [Flask-UI](https://github.com/KDI-2023/flask-ui) is an implementation of this feature.
